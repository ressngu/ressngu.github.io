# Children facing COVID-19
In the past few years, children have been hit especially hard in key developmental stages. Children under the age of 12 can't get vaccinated; however, it is still important to keep them safe as schools open.

As Team Captain of my APSC 171 CAD/CAM course, I coordinated brainstorming, 3D design, and prototyping. I also helped to investigate and implement solutions to faults during fabrication.

# The Easy-Squeezy
The Easy-Squeezy is a child-size, customizable, and tactile sanitizer. It is designed to be portable and attach to backpacks to prevent loss and promote use.

The small device mimics a stress ball, making the application of hand sanitizer fun and easy. A velcro attachment allows versatility of the Easy-Squeezy, while the refillable body promotes a long product life-span. Compared to disposable hand sanitizer bottles, the Easy-Squeezy is a more eco-friendly product.

# Design and Prototyping
The Easy-Squeezy is composed of five 3D printed parts, a push-spray cap, a velcro strap, and a carabiner. To operate the device grab it with the hole-opening facing the palm of your hand. Then, squeeze. Because ease-of-use is very important with such a product, two prototypes were used to improve functionality.

## Prototype 1

The first prototype was used to test the functionality and size of the sprayer. It featured four parts: the body, cap, a screw attachments, and a handle.

## Prototype 2

From the first prototype, we learned what necessary changes to make in the second prototype. The second prototype offers curved edges to improve comfortability in hand. The volume of the body was expanded and made hollow ot allow for increased hand-sanitizer storage. For refilling hand-sanitizer, the push-button was split into two parts and connected via a dowel joint.

## Future prototypes

While we have only designed a single size of the product, future iterations will allow for improved functionality and size variations for different hands. We also plan to add customizable colors and designs.

# Conclusion
Throughout COVID-19, there have been many difficulties keeping safety precautions in classrooms and other spaces. It is hard for children to understand why we need to wear masks and take protective measures. Thus, children often do not wear their masks correctly and forget to sanitize their hands, making both inherently inneffective. These difficulties inspired our team to focus our demographic on children.
