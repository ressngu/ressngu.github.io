  I am Ress Nguyen, a first year at the University of British Columbia studying Engineering. My interests lie in product design, sustainability, 3D modelling, and solving problems using engigneering principles. I like to solve any problem that comes my way using creative methods and by thinking outside-the-box. I work on projects related to current-day issues and Computer-Aided Design.
